# Simple Python Calculator

A basic Python calculator that supports arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and percentage calculations. It allows users to input numbers, perform operations, and view results, with history tracking and error handling.

## Features
- Supports basic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`.
- Tracks operation history.
- Handles division by zero errors.
- Allows users to continue, restart, or exit at any time.

## Installation
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Run the Python script:

   ```bash
   python calculator.py
   ```

## Usage
1. Enter a starting number.
2. Choose an arithmetic operation.
3. Enter the second number and see the result.
4. You can continue performing more operations, start over, or exit.
5. Type `'e'` at any prompt to exit.

## Example

```
Enter the first number: 100
Enter an operation (+, -, *, /, %): %
Enter the next number: 2
Current result: 2.0
Do you want to continue (c), start over (s), or exit (e)? e
Final result: 2.0
Operation history:
Start: 100.0
100.0 % 2.0 = 2.0
```
